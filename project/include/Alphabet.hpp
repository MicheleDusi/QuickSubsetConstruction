 * Header file for the definition of the Alphabet concept. 
 * This definition is used in the automata generation process and in the automaton definition.
 * 
 * An alphabet is a set of "symbols". Every symbol is implemented, in this projects, as a string.
 * This solution allows a better versatility and it doesn't limit the cardinality of the alphabet to the 
 * latin alphabet.
 * 
 * This header file contains also the definition of the epsilon label, used to represent the epsilon transition.
 * The epsilon label is never contained in the alphabet of the automaton.
